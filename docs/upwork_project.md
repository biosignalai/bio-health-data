# Upwork Project — Biosignal Analytics with AI (Apple Health → InfluxDB → Grafana)

**Deliverable:** working demo + write-up showing:
1) ingest & tidy Apple Health data,
2) time-series storage in InfluxDB,
3) Grafana dashboards,
4) an **AI roadmap** from trends → prediction → personalized guidance.

---

## What clients see (portfolio highlights)
- Clean repo with charts: HRV, Resting HR, Steps
- Clear pipeline diagram & explanation (Overview doc)
- AI roadmap with concrete next steps + risk/assumption notes
- Emphasis on **privacy**, **reproducibility**, and **portability**

---

## Tech stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy; optional: Prophet/statsmodels/sklearn)
- **InfluxDB 2.x** (buckets, tokens)
- **Grafana** (InfluxDB datasource)
- **(Private) Dockerized infra** for real deployments

---

## Roadmap (phases offered to clients)
1. **Descriptive**: data QA, coverage scan, rolling & seasonal trends, informative dashboards.
2. **Predictive**: baselines (Prophet/ARIMA) and ML (gradient boosting) for HRV/RHR with feature importances.
3. **Anomaly detection**: STL residuals; joint HRV–RHR alerts.
4. **Prescriptive + LLM**: rule-guided recommendations; LLM narratives grounded in the timeseries.
5. **Personalization**: per-user priors, calibration, and periodic model refresh.

---

## Engagement options
- **Fixed-scope demo** (like this repo) for a specific metric set.
- **Custom data fusion** (sleep, workouts, CGM, wearables).
- **Productionization** in client infra (Docker/K8s, auth, SSO, monitoring).
